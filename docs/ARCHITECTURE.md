# Architecture

Michi Micro Server is organized as a Rust workspace with a modular crate structure.

## Design Principles

- **Separation of concerns**: Each crate has a single responsibility.
- **Extensibility**: Future features are isolated in their own crates.
- **Error handling**: All fallible operations return typed errors via `thiserror`.
- **Observability**: All internal logging uses `tracing`.
- **Configuration**: Environment-driven configuration with sensible defaults.

## Crate Descriptions

### michi-core
Contains all shared data types: `Track`, `AudioFormat`, `AudioMetadata`, `LibraryStats`, `TrackUpdate`. These models are designed to be compatible with Michi Music Player and Michi Mobile for future sync capabilities.

Key utility functions:
- `track_id_from_path()` — generates UUID v5 from a normalized full file path (legacy fallback)
- `track_id_from_library_path()` — generates UUID v5 from the **relative** path within the music library. This makes IDs stable across different mount points (e.g., `/music` vs `/mnt/music`) as long as the relative path is the same.
- `is_path_inside_library()` — canonicalizes both paths and validates that a file resides within the library root. Prevents path traversal attacks. Returns a `Result<bool, PathError>` with typed errors.
- `PathError` — typed error enum for path resolution failures (`CannotCanonicalizeRoot`, `CannotCanonicalizeFile`).
- `AudioFormat` — `#[non_exhaustive]` enum allowing new formats to be added without breaking changes. Implements `Display` and `FromStr`.

### michi-api
Axum-based HTTP router. Defines all endpoints and handlers. Receives shared state (Config).

Serves both JSON API endpoints (`/api/*`) and the Web UI at `GET /`. The Web UI is a self-contained HTML page with embedded CSS and vanilla JavaScript that consumes the API endpoints.

### michi-config
Reads configuration from environment variables with defaults suitable for containerized deployment.

### michi-db
SQLite database layer using SQLx. Handles connection pooling and schema migrations.

### michi-metadata
Audio metadata extraction using the Lofty crate. Parses tags and audio properties from music files.

### michi-scanner
Recursively scans directories for audio files, reads metadata, and builds a track database. 

Key behaviors:
- IDs are generated from the **relative path** within the library root via `track_id_from_library_path()`, ensuring stable IDs across mount points.
- Symlinks are **skipped** to prevent accidental traversal outside the library.
- Unreadable/corrupt files do not stop the scan; a warning is logged and the file is still registered with unknown metadata.
- Only supported audio extensions are processed (mp3, flac, ogg, opus, aac, m4a, wav, aiff, aif, dsf, dff).
- Blocking I/O runs inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` to avoid blocking the async runtime.

### michi-streaming
Audio streaming with HTTP Range Request support. Provides:
- `parse_range()` — parses `Range` headers into start/end byte offsets
- `validate_track_path()` — canonicalizes paths and prevents directory traversal
- `open_track_file_async()` — resolves a track's file path and opens it for async reading
- `mime_type_for_ext()` — maps file extensions to audio MIME types

The crate is consumed by `michi-api` handlers and calls `michi-db` to look up tracks. It intentionally contains no HTTP or database logic — only file I/O and range math.

### Placeholder Crates (Inactive)
`michi-homeassistant`, `michi-sync`, and `michi-multiroom` are present in the filesystem but commented out of `Cargo.toml` workspace `members` until actively developed.

## Web UI

The Web UI is a self-contained HTML page with embedded CSS and vanilla JavaScript served at `GET /`. It consumes the JSON API endpoints directly:
- `/api/status` — Server health and version
- `/api/library/stats` — Track/album/artist counts
- `/api/tracks` — Full track listing (supports `?limit=&offset=` for pagination)
- `/api/search?q=` — Case-insensitive search across title, artist, album, album_artist, format
- `/api/stream/:id` — Audio playback with `<audio>` element
- `/api/library/scan` — Trigger library rescan
- `/api/library/tracks` — Clear library (with DELETE + confirm dialog)

## Data Flow

```
Config (env) → main.rs → Router (michi-api)
                                  ↓
                           HTTP Request
                                  ↓
                           Handler → Response
```

When scanning:
```
Scanner → Metadata Reader → Database
```

When streaming:
```
Client → /api/stream/:id → michi-api handler → michi-db (lookup) → michi-streaming (file I/O) → Response
```
